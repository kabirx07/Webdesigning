Theory Assignment 


1.)Explain the structure of an HTML document and the purpose of DOCTYPE


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Title of the document</title>
</head>

<body>
The content of the document......
</body>

</html>

An HTML document has a structured format starting with a DOCTYPE declaration, followed by the root element <html>, and then the document's content within the <head> and <body> elements. The DOCTYPE declaration specifies the document type and version, informing the browser how to interpret the HTML code. 



2.)List and explain at least five common HTML tags used in website design.

Here are five common HTML tags used in website design: 
<body>: This tag defines the main content of a webpage, which is what users will actually see when they visit the page.

<p>: The <p> tag defines a paragraph of text.

<h1> to <h6>: These tags define headings for sections on the page, with <h1> being the most important and <h6> the least.

<a>: The <a> tag is used to create hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate to other pages or sections on the same page.

<img>: The <img> tag is used to embed images in the webpage.



3.)Describe the difference between block-level and inline elements in HTML


In HTML, block-level elements always start on a new line and take up the full width available, while inline elements display in a line and only occupy the necessary space. Block elements are generally used for structural components, like paragraphs, while inline elements are used for formatting text or creating links. 

Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.
