Theory Assignments


1.) What is looping? Why is it required?

Looping means repeating a block of code multiple times.
It is required to perform repetitive tasks efficiently without writing the same 
code again, making programs shorter and faster.

Common loops include:

for loop
while loop
do…while loop

Why is it required?
a. To avoid writing the same code again and again
b. To handle repetitive tasks (like printing numbers, processing lists, etc.)
c. To make programs faster, cleaner, and more efficient



2.) Explain for, while, and do-while loops.

1. for Loop

Used when you know how many times you want to repeat the code.

Example:
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
This prints numbers 1 to 5.

2. while Loop

Runs as long as the condition is true.
Used when you don’t know the exact number of repetitions beforehand.

Example:
let i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}

3. do–while Loop

Similar to while, but the code runs at least once, even if the condition is false.

Example:
let i = 1;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i <= 5);



3.) What is for-of loop? When is it used?

What is the for-of Loop?

The for-of loop is used to iterate over iterable objects like arrays, strings, maps, sets, 
etc.It gives you each value directly, making it simpler than a traditional for loop.

Example:
let colors = ["red", "blue", "green"];

for (let color of colors) {
  console.log(color);
}
This prints each color.


Use the for-of loop when you want to:

1. Loop through values of an array or string

2. Write cleaner, more readable code

3. Avoid dealing with indexes manually

4. Iterate through data structures like Maps, Sets, and more



4.) Explain break and continue statements.

a.) break Statement

The break statement is used to stop a loop immediately.
When break runs, the loop ends and control moves to the code after the loop.

Example:
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  if (i === 3) break;
  console.log(i);
}

Output: 1, 2 (loop stops at 3)


b.) continue Statement

The continue statement skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next one.

Example:
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  if (i === 3) continue;
  console.log(i);
}

Output: 1, 2, 4, 5 (3 is skipped)
