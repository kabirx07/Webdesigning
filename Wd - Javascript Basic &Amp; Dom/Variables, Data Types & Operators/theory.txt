Theory Assignments


1.) Explain var, let, and const with examples.


A) var

a. Function-scoped
b. Can be redeclared and updated

Example:

var a = 10;
var a = 20; // allowed


B) let

a. Block-scoped
b. Cannot be redeclared (same block)
c. Can be updated

Example:

let b = 10;
b = 20; // allowed


C) Const

a. Block-scoped
b. Cannot be redeclared or updated

Example:

const c = 10;
// c = 20; // not allowed



2.) What are JavaScript data types? Explain string, number, boolean, array, and object.


-> JavaScript Data Types

JavaScript has different data types used to store different kinds of values.

1) String
a. Represents text.
b. Written inside quotes.

Example:
let name = "Alice";

2) Number
a. Represents numeric values (both integers and decimals).

Example:
let age = 25;
let price = 19.99;

3) Boolean
a. Represents true or false values.
b. Often used in conditions.

Example:
let isOnline = true;

4) Array
a. Stores multiple values in a single variable.
b. Values are placed inside [ ].

Example:
let colors = ["red", "blue", "green"];

5) Object
a. Stores data in key-value pairs.
b. Values are inside { }.

Example:
let person = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };



3.) Explain variable scope and memory concept in JavaScript.


-> Variable Scope

Variable scope decides where a variable can be accessed.

a. Global scope: Available everywhere.

b. Function scope (var): Only inside the function where it is declared.

c. Block scope (let, const): Only inside { } blocks like if, loops, etc.

-> Memory Concept

JavaScript stores values in two main memory areas:

a. Stack: Stores primitive values (number, string, boolean). Fast and direct.

b. Heap: Stores objects, arrays, and functions. Variables store a reference to these values.

JavaScript also uses garbage collection to free memory that is no longer needed



4.) Describe arithmetic, comparison, logical, and ternary operators.


1. Arithmetic Operators
Used for basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Example: 10 + 5

2. Comparison Operators
Compare two values and return true or false.
Example: 10 > 5

3. Logical Operators
Combine or invert conditions (AND, OR, NOT).
Example: true && false

4. Ternary Operator
A shorthand if–else used for quick decisions.
Example: age >= 18 ? "Adult" : "Minor"



5.) What is the difference between == and ===?


== (Loose Equality)

Compares values only.
Performs type conversion before comparing.
Example:

5 == "5"; // true (string converted to number)


=== (Strict Equality)

Compares both value and data type.
No type conversion is done.
Example:

5 === "5"; // false (different types)
