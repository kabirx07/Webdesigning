        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It describes the structure of a webpage using elements and tags. HTML elements are represented by tags, which can include attributes to provide additional information about the element.
        HTML is used to define the content and layout of a webpage, including headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists, and more. It is often used in conjunction with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.
