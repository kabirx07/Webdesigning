1.) What is form validation? Why is it required?


Form validation is the process of ensuring that the data entered by a user into a web form is correct, 
complete, and secure before it is sent to the server.

Why it is required

a. Prevents invalid data (e.g., wrong email format, empty fields).
b. Improves user experience by catching errors early (client-side validation).
c. Protects the server from malicious inputs (server-side validation).
d. Ensures data integrity by accepting only properly formatted values.
e. Reduces server load by blocking incorrect submissions early.


2.) Explain email validation using regular expressions.

Email validation ensures that an entered email matches the general pattern of a real email address.

A common regular expression (regex) for email validation is:
/^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/

How this regex works:

a.) ^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+
The local part (before @): letters, digits, dot, underscore, percent, plus, hyphen.

b.) @
Mandatory @ symbol.

c.) [a-zA-Z0-9.-]+
Domain name: letters, digits, dots, hyphens.

d.) \.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$
Top-level domain (e.g., .com, .org), at least 2 letters.



3.) Explain password validation rules.

Password validation ensures that a user creates a strong and secure password.

Common password validation rules:

1. Minimum length (e.g., at least 8 characters).
2. At least one uppercase letter (A–Z).
3. At least one lowercase letter (a–z).
4. At least one digit (0–9).
5. At least one special character (e.g., @, #, $, %, &).
6. No spaces allowed.
7. Should not be easily guessable (like “123456”, “password”, etc.).


4.) What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML?

Using innerHTML can cause several issues:

Disadvantages

1.) Security risk (XSS attacks)
If user input is inserted directly, malicious scripts may run.

2.) Performance overhead
Replaces the entire HTML content (even if you modify just a small part), making the browser re-parse all HTML.

3.) Event handlers removed
Replacing content using innerHTML removes existing event listeners inside that element.

4.) Invalid HTML problems
If you insert malformed HTML, the browser may behave unexpectedly.

5.) No direct script execution
JavaScript added within innerHTML does not run automatically in many browsers.
