Theory Assignments


1.) What is a function? Explain function declaration and calling.

A function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task. 
Instead of writing the same code repeatedly, you can place it inside a function 
and “call” the function whenever you need it.


function declaration means defining a function—giving it a name and specifying 
what it does.
for eg.

function greet(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name);
}


Once you declare a function, you must call it to make it run.

Example:
greet("Alice");


2.) Explain parameters and return values.


Parameters are variables listed inside the parentheses when you declare a function.
They act as placeholders for the values the function will receive.

Example:
function greet(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name);
}

name is a parameter

It represents a value you will pass later (like "Alice")

You can have multiple parameters:

function add(a, b) {
    console.log(a + b);
}

Here, a and b are parameters.

Return Value:
A return value is the output that a function sends back using the return keyword.

Example:
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;  // Returns the sum
}

let result = add(5, 3);
console.log(result);  // Output: 8

return a + b sends the result back to where the function was called

The returned value can be stored in a variable (result)



3.) What are arrow functions?


Arrow functions are a shorter way to write functions in JavaScript using the => syntax.

Example:
const add = (a, b) => a + b;

Key points:
1. Short and clean syntax
2. Can return values without using return (implicit return)
3. Do not have their own this keyword
4. Great for simple functions and callbacks



4.) What is function scope?


Function Scope 

1. Variables declared with var, let, or const inside a function are private to that function.
2. They cannot be used or accessed outside the function.

Example:
function test() {
    let x = 10;   // x is inside function scope
    console.log(x);  //  Works
}

test();
console.log(x);    //  Error: x is not defined.



5.) Explain modularity and code reusability.

Modularity means organizing your code into separate, logical parts (like functions or modules).
Each part handles a specific task, making the program easier to manage.

Example:

function calculateTotal() { ... }
function applyDiscount() { ... }

Each function is its own module with a clear purpose.



Code reusability means writing code that can be used multiple times instead of rewriting it.
Functions, modules, and classes help you reuse logic across the program.

Example:

function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

add(5, 3);
add(10, 2); // same function reused
