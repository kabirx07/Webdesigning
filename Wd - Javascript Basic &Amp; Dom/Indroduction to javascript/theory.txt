Theory Assignments


1.) What is JavaScript? Explain its role in modern web development.

JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language that is a core technology of the World Wide Web, 
alongside HTML and CSS


Role of JavaScript in Modern Web Development

a. Adds interactivity to web pages (animations, forms, dynamic content).

b. Builds modern UIs using frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular.

c. Handles server-side logic with Node.js.

d. Enables async data fetching (APIs, real-time updates).

e. Powers mobile and desktop apps through cross-platform tools.

f. Controls browser features using built-in APIs (storage, media, geolocation).



2.) Where does JavaScript execute? Explain client-side execution.

->JavaScript executes in two main environments:

1. In the browser (Client-side)
2. On the server (Server-side, e.g., Node.js)


Client-side execution

Client-side JavaScript runs directly in the user’s browser. The browser’s JS engine (like V8 or SpiderMonkey)
executes the code after the webpage loads. It lets the script interact with the page’s elements (DOM), handle 
user actions, update content instantly, and make thepage dynamic without needing to reload. This reduces server 
load and improves user experience.



3.) Differentiate between internal and external JavaScript.


-> Internal JavaScript

a. Written inside the HTML file using the <script> tag.

b. Placed within the <head> or <body>.

c. Good for small scripts.

d. Harder to maintain if the code grows.


-> External JavaScript

a. Written in a separate .js file.

b. Linked to the HTML using the src attribute in <script>.

c. Better for larger projects and reusability.

d. Makes code cleaner and easier to maintain.



4.) What is the use of console.log()?


console.log() is used to print messages to the browser’s console.

-> Uses of console.log()

a. To debug code by checking values of variables.

b. To display messages, errors, or results during development.

c. To track program flow and see what code is running.


5.) Explain how debugging is done using browser developer tools.


Debugging with browser developer tools is done by opening DevTools (F12) and using features like the Console 
to view errors and log messages, and the Sources tab to set breakpoints. When a breakpoint is hit, the code 
pauses, allowing you to inspect variables, step through code, and find where things go wrong. The Network tab 
can also be used to check API calls and responses.
